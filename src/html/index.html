		<p>My name is Sergei Ikonnikov and I love to create the music. I like to begin my music projects from the entire idea to the last notes. Usually I compose using virtual instruments in digital audio workstation on PC. It's almost true I work in digital only, but:</p>
		<ul class="list-group">
			<li class="list-group-item">-sometimes I record other people. Usually they are bass/guitar players or signers.</li>
			<li class="list-group-item">-sometimes I record myself. Yeah, Usually I record bass and electric guitar.</li>
			</ul>

		<h3 class="py-2 ml-2">Short story</h3>
		<p>I'm an independent composer and musician from Russia, borned in Novosibirsk city. I've started to learn guitar and play in local bands since 2003. I've started to learn digital recording in 2013 and tried myself as a composer/sound-designer. It was a time when indipendent company called "FateStudio" invited me to create games. That's how I started to create music/soundtracks since august 2013</p>
		<hr>
		<h3 class="py-2 ml-2">Present days</h3>
		<p>I've got the experience and have a bunch of tracks, today. I've tried some DAWs (digital audio workstations) software and decided to use the last one from the list:</p>

		<p>I've learned mixing and mastering. I've learned how to use a virtual instruments and how to made them sound more natural, learned that not all of them could sound as natural as the real ones, so I'm always in the search in new ones to add them in my library.<br> Can't say that the live is so bright than I'm thinking about my live perfomances or daily practices cause of time. The time limits my possibilities but I'm still trying to study some instruments. Here's the list:</p>

		<h3 class="py-2 ml-2">Passion to music</h2>
		<!-- <h3 class="py-2 ml-2">Long story...</h3> -->
		<h5>The first intrument</h5>
		<p>String music instruments is my passion from the begining. I'm telling about a guitar, ofcourse. Guitar was the first music instrument my hands reached when I grew up. I studied electric guitar the most part of my music life and learned how to play it without any help, except some advices from my friends. But I can't say that I've mastered guitar, I'm too far to become a local professional of guitar. So far so good I can play what I need.</p>
		<h5>Digital Audio Workstations. First steps.</h5>
		<p>My first record was published after some years past. The first steps were the most hard, because you never knew how this works or even will it work. All guitar tracks I've recorded were sounding not natural and got noises. I have no music tracks from those times...and I'm glad that I don't have any. New tracks sounds better and I can proud with them.</p>
		<h5>Becoming a composer</h5>
		<p>Working in IT industry I've met a lot of good people. Men who founded a a little company of indie developers were one of those good peaple.<br>I left my work to join them and try myself as a composer and sound-designer, after some time was spent on talks and to made a test tasks. It was a time "I wanted to start from the begining"&copy; so I've spent some time to get some money and leave to my new "work".<br>"This track is good, but we should move ahead."&copy; Andrew Viktorov<br>Those words were waiting for me after every track. It was joyful. Company was called "Fate Studio" and our ship couldn't make it.</p>
		<h5>My first album, and goodbye to "Fate Studio".</h5>
		<p>Good times couldn't lasts forever. I've reached my limits in money, so I went to the job after some time. But I have a portfolio since those times attached on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/isgguitar">SoundCloud</a> website and I've learned a lot new. The list of my live instruments were:</p>
			<!-- можно ссылки на википедию закинуть -->
			<ul class="list-group w-50">
				<li class="list-group-item">Electric guitar</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Bass guitar</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Ukulele</li>
			</ul>
		<p>I've continued to improve my skill at a free time and passed to another important event of my life. I've decided to record my first full album. It was dedicated to my ex band called "Shine now". I called it "Dash". <a href="https://isgguitar.bandcamp.com/releases">Here's the link</a>. Album was done, I've got a lot of exp and got "level up". The points were spent on "play drums" skill. Yeah, I've played drums about a half year when album was done. "This track is good, but we should move ahead."&copy;</p>
